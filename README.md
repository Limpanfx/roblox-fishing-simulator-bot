## Extra information: 
- Rain can interfere with the bubble color checking, causing extra clicks and breaking the bot; avoid rainy weather by taking cover where the rain is not visible on your screen.
- The bubbles must be the original color because of the color check, so you cannot use this bot for fishing in lava or similar.
- Private servers are free and highly recommended, since using bots is bannable.
- This code is designed for 1920×1080 monitors.
